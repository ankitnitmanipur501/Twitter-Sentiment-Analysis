# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This project was motivated by my desire to investigate the sentiment analysis field of machine learning since it allows to approach natural language processing.
Sentiment analysis, also refers as opinion mining, is a sub machine learning task where
we want to determine which is the general sentiment of a given document. Using machine
learning techniques and natural language processing we can extract the subjective information
of a document and try to classify it according to its polarity such as positive, neutral or negative.
It is a really useful analysis since we could possibly determine the overall opinion about a selling
objects, or predict stock markets for a given company like, if most people think positive about it,
possibly its stock markets will increase, and so on. Sentiment analysis is actually far from to be
solved since the language is very complex
